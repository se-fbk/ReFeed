89,"Hello,
first of all a heartily thank you for that good website. I use it currently for electricity, heating and water consumption. I would also like to use it for the mobility, because I would like to monitor our overall energy consumption. Unfortunately, there is a problem with the input of fuel bills. We use a natural gas vehicle so it costs less than 20 € to recharge it completely. The entry of such low cost associated with a fully recharge is not allowed by the system. Currently I recording my vehicle consumption with spritmonitor.de. Perhaps you can find inspiration there. Obviously for me it would be optimal having a importer from spritmonitor.de in your portal. As an improvement proposal I would still like to see my annual energy consumption in a pie chart, split into energy (electricity, gas, petrol) and by use (household, mobility, heat).

182,"Hello,
i think the idea you follow with iESA is very good.
TIl now i built EXCEL tables, what is costly and reminder to read off wasnt there.
Also i forgot it very often. This could be good solution - comparison with average is also aviable.

so far so good. Though i bumped on a problem on the site pretty fast, for which i didnt find a solution.

You offer indeed a section for photovoltaic, but in my opinion there is inevitably an fault created in your evaluation : 
indeed i have two direction meter for measuring the electricity consumped from electricity supply system and injected into supply system by me.
But when i enter the data here on this page as u have scheduled, you take my entries and calculate my consumptions from supply system, also you take my injected electricity to calculate the output from my photovoltaic device. But both is wrong, where is the consumption of electricity produced by myself? For example i consumed in march 72% of total device production myself. This self-used electricity is not shown in both meters.
It sounds a bit like you expect the device to inject complete produced electricity, that absolutly doesnt make sence because of current regulations. The goal is self consumption! And that i get (and others surely too) to such high values, since i combined a battery with the system.

So a field would be needed to enter absolute values and not meter readings. I have this values because they are collected by the system monitor of the battery.

Do you know about this problem and do you already have solution?

124,"Hello,
As I have told you a few weeks ago, that impossible values will shown in the heating section diagram. Until July, the fuel levels are shown correctly. In August no consumption is shown although the fuel level decreased by 25 liters. In September, we consume 10 liters. On the heating side, consumption of 8800 kWh appears instead. This corresponds roughly to our annual consumption but it will be shown as our monthly consumption. It would be great to be able to gain 9072 kWh of heat energy from 10 liters of heating oil. Please correct your calculations.
