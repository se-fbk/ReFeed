89,"Hello,
first of all a heartily thank you for that good website. I use it currently for electricity, heating and water consumption. I would also like to use it for the mobility, because I would like to monitor our overall energy consumption. Unfortunately, there is a problem with the input of fuel bills. We use a natural gas vehicle so it costs less than 20 € to recharge it completely. The entry of such low cost associated with a fully recharge is not allowed by the system. Currently I recording my vehicle consumption with spritmonitor.de. Perhaps you can find inspiration there. Obviously for me it would be optimal having a importer from spritmonitor.de in your portal. As an improvement proposal I would still like to see my annual energy consumption in a pie chart, split into energy (electricity, gas, petrol) and by use (household, mobility, heat).
Best wishes"

48,"Dear Ladies and Gentlemen,
I have now signed up for energy savings account, but can not enter data. On top right the message ""Read permission only"" appears, but under ""account permissions"" only the assignment of rights is possible. How do I get full access to my power saving account so I can start something?
Among the forum entries I could find no evidence and the hotline is despite the indication on weekdays from 10 - 17 o'clock not occupied.
Here is still significant need for improvement. There is no reason for a new user, as it receives a fully functional account. In addition, it reflects badly on the operator when the hotline is not staffed in the specified times.
Best regards"

171,"Good day, I record for some years my meter readings in your energy saving account. Now I have a problem in entering my water bill. My stand on the settlement was 350.703 m3, as I have also recorded it. Now an error message appears that says the state must be between 279.184 and 285.164 m3. This must be a validation error. Could you please check this and then let me know?
Thank you very much.

199,"I started with water bill because i thought i would be easier for me.
One main meter, no sub meter but meter exchange at 18.03 and yearly bill from 01.01. to 31.12.2015.
I give up after the date is resetted to 01.01.2016 without saving changes."
234,"I am excited energy saver and user of your site.
i have recommended the site to lot of people. Sadly with small success.
The electricity is simply far too cheap yet, to interest an ""usual"" household.
Today i exchanged a meter and i found it great, that all needed entries were asked for clearly.
Great!
Thank you!"

118,"Good morning,
I have an air source heat pump with a multi-rate meter. On the overview ""heating"" (heating energy September 2015) appears only ""similar households"". In ""My consumption"" nothing is displayed. Can you explain why that is the case?
Gladly I can also send you a screenshot.
Regards"
92,"Good Morning,
It is already quite often occurred that there is a strong deviation between the total consumption and the individual data entered! There was added partly an estimated power consumption of 12,000 kWh. I thought with the Export-delete and re-import this would be done now, but I can not define a NT neither HT counter!! Furthermore, how can I import the previous bills?
Request for recovery and cleanup my account / meter data!
Best regards"

only Hieroglyphen appear when I viewing my household??? I can not enter any meter readings?? What's happening??

182,"Hello,
i think the idea you follow with iESA is very good.
TIl now i built EXCEL tables, what is costly and reminder to read off wasnt there.
Also i forgot it very often. This could be good solution - comparison with average is also aviable.

so far so good. Though i bumped on a problem on the site pretty fast, for which i didnt find a solution.

You offer indeed a section for photovoltaic, but in my opinion there is inevitably an fault created in your evaluation : 
indeed i have two direction meter for measuring the electricity consumped from electricity supply system and injected into supply system by me.
But when i enter the data here on this page as u have scheduled, you take my entries and calculate my consumptions from supply system, also you take my injected electricity to calculate the output from my photovoltaic device. But both is wrong, where is the consumption of electricity produced by myself? For example i consumed in march 72% of total device production myself. This self-used electricity is not shown in both meters.
It sounds a bit like you expect the device to inject complete produced electricity, that absolutly doesnt make sence because of current regulations. The goal is self consumption! And that i get (and others surely too) to such high values, since i combined a battery with the system.

So a field would be needed to enter absolute values and not meter readings. I have this values because they are collected by the system monitor of the battery.

Do you know about this problem and do you already have solution?

Best regards"

I had, when it was still possible, create a few EAV analyzes but i did not save them.

288,"In our apartment facility I have an violation of the EnEV, § 14 (4) ""circulation pump operation"" detected (energy waste).

But it was not told what I have to do now to ensure that the violation will be checked and then be stopped by the building authority.
How should I proceed now ???"
124,"Hello,
As I have told you a few weeks ago, that impossible values will shown in the heating section diagram. Until July, the fuel levels are shown correctly. In August no consumption is shown although the fuel level decreased by 25 liters. In September, we consume 10 liters. On the heating side, consumption of 8800 kWh appears instead. This corresponds roughly to our annual consumption but it will be shown as our monthly consumption. It would be great to be able to gain 9072 kWh of heat energy from 10 liters of heating oil. Please correct your calculations.
Best regards"

106,"Dear Sir or Madam, 
as you can see in my account, I have a modern oil heating since, 2013. Nevertheless, my chimney sweep reviewed annually and increases the cost by 33% from 49.27 euros to 65.71 euros for 15 minutes presence. An hourly wage of 260 euros !! My questions: 
a) If annual or biennial chimney test is right? 
b) Can the chimney sweep may charge such high fees? 
Thank you for your answer."
8,"I have a problem with your ""similar households"". 
What are the criterias? Do they cheate or something like that ..."
20,"I noticed that the energy consumption compared to 'similar households' also depends on:
- whether the residents always stay 24/7 in the house (for example, pensioners, unemployed, home office ...)
- or if the residents during the day are away from home (traveling sales, on a work site)
In ""away from home"" a part of the energy consumption (water, electricity, heating) accrues elsewhere unless you want to take into account the overall energy balance.
Greetings from the woods edge"
