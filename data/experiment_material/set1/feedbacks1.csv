131,Regarding the natural gas consumption you must consider that the gas also can be used for cooking. Otherwise the value of the heater is established too high.
274,"Dear Ladies and Gentlemen,
How can I import my mobility data?
The description of the CSV-Upload provides for only two or three input columns for the CSV-File. To import fuel invoices I need probably even more columns (time, milage, quantity, cost, a full tank (yes / no)) - or is still not possible to import fuel bills? For a reasonable consumption control makes but only the import of fuel bills sense. To import only the kilometer data is in that case completely irrelevant?
Perhaps a small comment to the household overview page: The comparison with the ""standard consumption"" declared by the manufacturer is also not very helpful. It would be more interesting to compare with vehicles of the same type / or engine - or with the vehicles of other households (regardless of type).
Best regards"
298,"Dear Ladies and Gentlemen,
I was pleased today to notice that the data input into the energy savings account has become much faster. Congratulations!
Hopefully no fluke. The previous data input was ""very slow"" in the reaction. This led in part to the repeated pressing of the save button because for a long time no feedback appears. For your team all good wishes for the year 2015.
Sincerely"

Good Morning,
in my account on the heating side all meter readings are displayed with the date 06.12.2015. The trend and the consumption per month are calculated incorrectly."
256,"Dear Ladies and Gentlemen,
Why the program calculates at less gasoline consumption per 100 kilometers, almost double the costs per 100 kilometers?"
113,"Hello,
in my engergy savings account the heating diagram do not shows the oil level input from 01.12.2015.
What should I do?
Best wishes"
116,"We have installed a fuel cell 1 month ago. It would be nice if we could enter this heating system in your engergy saving account. 
It works similar to a photovoltaic system. Our plant produces 1.5 kWh of electricity continuously and 600 W thermal output. It Operates with natural gas."
239,"I can't deal with your ""energy savings account"", so I ask you to delete my registration with all the data.
With friendly greetings"

Hello, 
I got today delivered heating oil and the supplier has filled a little more oil in the tank as mathematically possible. Unfortunately your program refuses to enter the actual charged amount when the maximum level has been exceeded. I think that an overfill to a certain extent should be possible because no limit monitor can be set precisely enough. 
Best regards"
219,"Dear Ladies and Gentlemen,
I'm just about to enter my current data of the recent years. I would like to enter a meter reading with the value 271, but I get the hint that only a value of 197 is plausible. But I have a meter reading value of 271. What can I do?

Sincerely"
33,"Is it possible that you have ""twisted numbers"" in the calculation of the power consumption for a 2-person household? On the website of the power-saving initiative the average power consumption of 3200 kWh is listed. In your graphics is it 2300 kWh? 
Best wishes"
56,"Dear Ladies and Gentlemen,
just I registered on your energy saving account, but received no confirmation email.
I ask for verification.

78,"Despite I entered my separate monthly consumption, there is no consumption shown in the monthly statistics for August 2015. Why is that so?"
37,"Good morning. Yesterday, I changed my email address. Now I can not find my data anymore. Best Regards"

180,"On the subject of photovoltaics: As you know I run two PV systems on the roof of my private house. You can look at my records (last from today 31 March). The total monthly injections does not correspond to your chosen method of presentation in green and open bars. Please recheck your method of totaling the income of both separately measured systems.

I cant put in relation.

Thank you very much for your answer"

In the graphic is shown that the sum of this 3 months is 3760 kWh, but if i sum up the values, i get about 2000 kWh in same period of time."
6,"Hello 
I was about to set up a new vehicle. But for the fuel selection there is no option for electricity. It should have got around in an energy-saving portal, that there are also electric cars out there? Will the Fuel ""electric"" be offered in the future?"
227,"Hello, 
I had created two electricity meters; for the house and the apartment. When entering the last year's consumption figures, I have found out that the meter data are added together. How can I prevent this?"

Thanks and best regards"
7,"Dear energy saving team!
For me there is something wrong in the section of fuel consumption. Have entered to 08.12.15 all fuel invoices. Nevertheless, the fuel consumption and the distance traveled for November will be given partly estimated. Why is that so?
Best regards"

We have entered the consumption data for the natural gas. we have also an additional pellet heating system since 2010. How can we enter data for this? Under ""Help"" it will be explained, but we we can not proceed so because the item ""pellet"" is not listed under ""Add device"".
Requests for response. thank you"
63,Please delete my account so I can create a new one. I have accidentally given the information that I am tenants and in this mode it is not possible to enter meter readings. Thank you very much
86,The calculations are incorrect. For electricity and heating the total consumption does not appear.
