How can I import my mobility data?
The description of the CSV-Upload provides for only two or three input columns for the CSV-File. To import fuel invoices I need probably even more columns (time, milage, quantity, cost, a full tank (yes / no)) - or is still not possible to import fuel bills? For a reasonable consumption control makes but only the import of fuel bills sense. To import only the kilometer data is in that case completely irrelevant?
Perhaps a small comment to the household overview page: The comparison with the ""standard consumption"" declared by the manufacturer is also not very helpful. It would be more interesting to compare with vehicles of the same type / or engine - or with the vehicles of other households (regardless of type).
