1,"When you create a numbered list, by default you get ""1. 2. 3. - option"" if you chose for example ""a) b) c) - option"", then you write a piece of text not included in the numbered list, and then you want to include another numbered list, you get again ""1. 2. 3. - option"" and must change to ""a) b) c) - option"" if this is what you want. Enhancement: When using numbered lists, you must get by default the last option you choose instead of the ""1. 2. 3. - option""",0.09090909090909091
2,"I want to place a frame around a text line. I am doing this by marking the line and then choosing ""Tabelle"" ""Umwandeln"" ""Text in Tabelle"". The frame around the text line can be seen. When I am printing 2 pages on 1 sheet of paper (I am doing this for a huge book) the above line will not be printed. I know this problem from other tables. It can be frustrating. I can correct this by choosing ""Umrandungsstil"" 1pt. I feel ""1pt"" should be the default one without having to adjust for. Its a bad look and feel if you see a line on the screen but not on the printed paper using a standard Laser printer HP4000 with a standard driver. I also feel it would be an enhancement if by clicking on ""Tabelle"" ""Linienstil"" the actual value would be shown. So would be more easy to work with.  Best Regards Matthias Weisser",0.0625
3,"I have two documents. I wish to copy text from one and paste into the other. Both documents have their text font formatted as ""Times New Roman"" 12pt. Find test documents attached as Copy.odt and Paste.odt When I copy at least one full paragraph, (including the final hard return) and paste the text at the start of a paragraph, however, everything up to the last hard return is formatted as 10pt. Any partial paragraph up to the last hard return adopts the format of the paragraph it was pasted before. If I paste into the middle of a paragraph, or copy less than one paragraph without its hard return, the entire pasted text adopts the format of the paragraph it is pasted into. The key is copying and pasting between different documents. Pasting into the same document as copied from does not show this behavior. Paste Special... OpenOffice.org Writer shows the same behavior. Using Paste Special... Formatted Text (RTF) pastes the exact source format as expected, even across documents. Using Paste Special... Unformatted Text adopts the destination format as expected, even across documents. I have also verified this same behavior in OO.org Writer 1.0.4.17 (Novell Build) on Linux SUSE 10.",0.058823529411764705
4,Related to bug #79611 OOWriter should support bookmarks within frames aka shapes like for example within draw:text-box since 1. it is usefull and 2. the odf specs say that it's legal and imho OOWriter should follow the specs to be compatible to other word-processors like KWord where it's already implemented.,0.0625
5,"Since OOo does not provide the feature of inserting diagonal table header, the user will meet the following problems  when they use drawing tool to draw diagonal line in the cells to achieve that feature, the diagonal line won't be changed if the size of the cell changes, if the client wanna input word at the part of diagonal line he  can only do so by using self chosen text frame to input word which will be very inconvenient, so we can meet user's need by inserting diagonal line table header that is to  combine   inserting diagonal line with inputing word to fulfill the function of inserting diagonal line table header, we can add ""insert diagonal line table header "" menu item in the main menu ̢���Insert"" and at the same time we can build a box called"" inserting clined line table header"". the box of "" inserting clined line table header is used to provide the customer with the function of choosing clined line table header format, inputing word and choosing the font size of the word.",0.06060606060606061
7,"This is about dialog box that pops up with CTRL+P (or the File > Print... menu). It offers only two possible actions: Either press [OK] button to start printing straightaway; or [Cancel] to cancel all changes. But it does not allow two other important options: 1. Save all settings and exit (without needing to print anything) 2. Check how the current setting will affect the printed pages. In other words, give a direct link with ""page preview"". When he closes the ""Page preview"" window, the control should come back to the ""Print..."" window. This will allow the user to check the effect of his settings iteratively; so that he will take a print only when he is fully satisfied. BTW why call it ""page preview""? It should be called ""print preview""; because this view ACTUALLY shows how the **PRINT** looks.",0.043478260869565216
8,Fuirst create a document using Numbering types as appropirate for Bulgaria and Russia (using Cyrillic letters instead of Latin). Then save it as a Writter document in MS Office 2000 *.doc format. Then open it again to follow up the work with this document. When open again surprisingly the expected numbering type with cyrillic letters is lost. All Cyrillic letters in the numbering are replaced with numbers. Please see the attached file Cyrillic_Numbering_problems-OOo.zip with screen shots and the example file.,0.058823529411764705
10,"Current behaviour: * OOoWebWriter always shows absolute path (to image for example) * OOoWW saves the doc with absolute path or relative depending what settings are used I find this counterintuitive and the old mantra-acronym is violated – WYSIWYG. I would suggest: * OOoWW settings -- how the OOoWW should handle (i.e. display, save) path * OOoWW SHOWS and saves path depending what settings are used So, if I would like to work with relative path, when I link to image from current directory, I will see ""image.png"" so I would be sure it is relative, not ""/home/macias/..../image.png"" which would later be translated. Advantages: * WYSIWYG maintained + no need to check the saved doc if it is correct + valuable visual feedback right away * more intuitive way to handle links * one step less, or more exactly no additional steps",0.047619047619047616

15,"Our scenario: we need to write (technical) manuals with a few hundred pages. Therefore we've designed a very basic set of styles (heading, subheading, code,..) and want to force our writers to use only these styles. No own styles, no direct formatting,.. Since consistency is a must when writing documentation, any chance to format besides the ~10 default styles is not acceptable. Any realistic chance to see the feature implemented? Or can anyone estimate how much work it would be, since I'm a programmer myself.. (see also http://www.oooforum.org/forum/viewtopic.phtml?t=60359 )",0.125
