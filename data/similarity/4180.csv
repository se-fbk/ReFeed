2,"I want to place a frame around a text line. I am doing this by marking the line and then choosing ""Tabelle"" ""Umwandeln"" ""Text in Tabelle"". The frame around the text line can be seen. When I am printing 2 pages on 1 sheet of paper (I am doing this for a huge book) the above line will not be printed. I know this problem from other tables. It can be frustrating. I can correct this by choosing ""Umrandungsstil"" 1pt. I feel ""1pt"" should be the default one without having to adjust for. Its a bad look and feel if you see a line on the screen but not on the printed paper using a standard Laser printer HP4000 with a standard driver. I also feel it would be an enhancement if by clicking on ""Tabelle"" ""Linienstil"" the actual value would be shown. So would be more easy to work with.

4,Related to bug #79611 OOWriter should support bookmarks within frames aka shapes like for example within draw:text-box since 1. it is usefull and 2. the odf specs say that it's legal and imho OOWriter should follow the specs to be compatible to other word-processors like KWord where it's already implemented.,0.11538461538461539
5,"Since OOo does not provide the feature of inserting diagonal table header, the user will meet the following problems  when they use drawing tool to draw diagonal line in the cells to achieve that feature, the diagonal line won't be changed if the size of the cell changes, if the client wanna input word at the part of diagonal line he  can only do so by using self chosen text frame to input word which will be very inconvenient, so we can meet user's need by inserting diagonal line table header that is to  combine   inserting diagonal line with inputing word to fulfill the function of inserting diagonal line table header, we can add ""insert diagonal line table header "" menu item in the main menu ̢���Insert"" and at the same time we can build a box called"" inserting clined line table header"". the box of "" inserting clined line table header is used to provide the customer with the function of choosing clined line table header format, inputing word and choosing the font size of the word.",0.2702702702702703
7,"This is about dialog box that pops up with CTRL+P (or the File > Print... menu). It offers only two possible actions: Either press [OK] button to start printing straightaway; or [Cancel] to cancel all changes. But it does not allow two other important options: 1. Save all settings and exit (without needing to print anything) 2. Check how the current setting will affect the printed pages. In other words, give a direct link with ""page preview"". When he closes the ""Page preview"" window, the control should come back to the ""Print..."" window. This will allow the user to check the effect of his settings iteratively; so that he will take a print only when he is fully satisfied. BTW why call it ""page preview""? It should be called ""print preview""; because this view ACTUALLY shows how the **PRINT** looks.",0.3333333333333333
10,"Current behaviour: * OOoWebWriter always shows absolute path (to image for example) * OOoWW saves the doc with absolute path or relative depending what settings are used I find this counterintuitive and the old mantra-acronym is violated – WYSIWYG. I would suggest: * OOoWW settings -- how the OOoWW should handle (i.e. display, save) path * OOoWW SHOWS and saves path depending what settings are used So, if I would like to work with relative path, when I link to image from current directory, I will see ""image.png"" so I would be sure it is relative, not ""/home/macias/..../image.png"" which would later be translated. Advantages: * WYSIWYG maintained + no need to check the saved doc if it is correct + valuable visual feedback right away * more intuitive way to handle links * one step less, or more exactly no additional steps",0.13333333333333333
11,"The ""Save Merged Document"" option doesn't work. I open my Starting Document, go to step 8. The merge wizard says its creating 3 documents (the number of records in my Data Source). I Click ""Save Merged Document"" and then ""Save Documents"" and check the ""Save As Single Document"" option, but the resulting document contains only the last of the 3 data-record-documents.",0.18518518518518517
13,"This issue has been split from issue 80204. See attached RTF - the last line breaks onto a new page, which is not the case in MS Word. Same document as .doc gives the same result in Writer. At first glance I noticed a small ""mismatch"" in the large block of empty paragraphs in the lower part of page 1. Maybe problem is there.",0.04
15,"Our scenario: we need to write (technical) manuals with a few hundred pages. Therefore we've designed a very basic set of styles (heading, subheading, code,..) and want to force our writers to use only these styles. No own styles, no direct formatting,.. Since consistency is a must when writing documentation, any chance to format besides the ~10 default styles is not acceptable. Any realistic chance to see the feature implemented? Or can anyone estimate how much work it would be, since I'm a programmer myself.. (see also http://www.oooforum.org/forum/viewtopic.phtml?t=60359 )",0.15384615384615385
