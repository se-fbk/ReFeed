2,"I want to place a frame around a text line. I am doing this by marking the line and then choosing ""Tabelle"" ""Umwandeln"" ""Text in Tabelle"". The frame around the text line can be seen. When I am printing 2 pages on 1 sheet of paper (I am doing this for a huge book) the above line will not be printed. I know this problem from other tables. It can be frustrating. I can correct this by choosing ""Umrandungsstil"" 1pt. I feel ""1pt"" should be the default one without having to adjust for. Its a bad look and feel if you see a line on the screen but not on the printed paper using a standard Laser printer HP4000 with a standard driver. I also feel it would be an enhancement if by clicking on ""Tabelle"" ""Linienstil"" the actual value would be shown. So would be more easy to work with.  Best Regards Matthias Weisser",0.0625
5,"Since OOo does not provide the feature of inserting diagonal table header, the user will meet the following problems  when they use drawing tool to draw diagonal line in the cells to achieve that feature, the diagonal line won't be changed if the size of the cell changes, if the client wanna input word at the part of diagonal line he  can only do so by using self chosen text frame to input word which will be very inconvenient, so we can meet user's need by inserting diagonal line table header that is to  combine   inserting diagonal line with inputing word to fulfill the function of inserting diagonal line table header, we can add ""insert diagonal line table header "" menu item in the main menu ̢���Insert"" and at the same time we can build a box called"" inserting clined line table header"". the box of "" inserting clined line table header is used to provide the customer with the function of choosing clined line table header format, inputing word and choosing the font size of the word.",0.029411764705882353
11,"The ""Save Merged Document"" option doesn't work. I open my Starting Document, go to step 8. The merge wizard says its creating 3 documents (the number of records in my Data Source). I Click ""Save Merged Document"" and then ""Save Documents"" and check the ""Save As Single Document"" option, but the resulting document contains only the last of the 3 data-record-documents.",0.05263157894736842
15,"Our scenario: we need to write (technical) manuals with a few hundred pages. Therefore we've designed a very basic set of styles (heading, subheading, code,..) and want to force our writers to use only these styles. No own styles, no direct formatting,.. Since consistency is a must when writing documentation, any chance to format besides the ~10 default styles is not acceptable. Any realistic chance to see the feature implemented? Or can anyone estimate how much work it would be, since I'm a programmer myself.. (see also http://www.oooforum.org/forum/viewtopic.phtml?t=60359 )",0.058823529411764705
