2,"I want to place a frame around a text line. I am doing this by marking the line and then choosing ""Tabelle"" ""Umwandeln"" ""Text in Tabelle"". The frame around the text line can be seen.

I can correct this by choosing ""Umrandungsstil"" 1pt. I feel ""1pt"" should be the default one without having to adjust for. Its a bad look and feel if you see a line on the screen but not on the printed paper using a standard Laser printer HP4000 with a standard driver.
