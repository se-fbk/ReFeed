2,"I want to place a frame around a text line. I am doing this by marking the line and then choosing ""Tabelle"" ""Umwandeln"" ""Text in Tabelle"". The frame around the text line can be seen. When I am printing 2 pages on 1 sheet of paper (I am doing this for a huge book) the above line will not be printed. I know this problem from other tables. It can be frustrating. I can correct this by choosing ""Umrandungsstil"" 1pt. I feel ""1pt"" should be the default one without having to adjust for. Its a bad look and feel if you see a line on the screen but not on the printed paper using a standard Laser printer HP4000 with a standard driver. I also feel it would be an enhancement if by clicking on ""Tabelle"" ""Linienstil"" the actual value would be shown. So would be more easy to work with.
