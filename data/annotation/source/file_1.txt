When you create a numbered list by default you get 1. 2. 3. option if you chose for example a b c option then you write a piece of text not included in the numbered list and then you want to include another numbered list you get again 1. 2. 3. option and must change to a b c option if this is what you want. Enhancement: When using numbered lists you must get by default the last option you choose instead of the 1. 2. 3. option
