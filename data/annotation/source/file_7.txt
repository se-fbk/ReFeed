This is about dialog box that pops up with CTRL+P or the File Print... menu. It offers only two possible actions: Either press [OK] button to start printing straightaway; or [Cancel] to cancel all changes. But it does not allow two other important options: 1. Save all settings and exit without needing to print anything 2. Check how the current setting will affect the printed pages. In other words give a direct link with page preview. When he closes the Page preview window the control should come back to the Print... window. This will allow the user to check the effect of his settings iteratively; so that he will take a print only when he is fully satisfied. BTW why call it page preview? It should be called print preview ; because this view ACTUALLY shows how the PRINT looks.
