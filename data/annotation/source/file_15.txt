Our scenario: we need to write technical manuals with a few hundred pages. Therefore we have designed a very basic set of styles heading subheading code .. and want to force our writers to use only these styles. No own styles no direct formatting .. Since consistency is a must when writing documentation any chance to format besides the ~10 default styles is not acceptable. Any realistic chance to see the feature implemented? Or can anyone estimate how much work it would be since I am a programmer myself.. see also http://www.
