Current behaviour: OOoWebWriter always shows absolute path to image for example OOoWW saves the doc with absolute path or relative depending what settings are used I find this counterintuitive and the old mantra acronym is violated – WYSIWYG. I would suggest: OOoWW settings how the OOoWW should handle i.e. display save path OOoWW SHOWS and saves path depending what settings are used So if I would like to work with relative path when I link to image from current directory I will see image png so I would be sure it is relative not /home/macias../image png which would later be translated. Advantages: WYSIWYG maintained + no need to check the saved doc if it is correct + valuable visual feedback right away more intuitive way to handle links one step less or more exactly no additional steps
