I want to place a frame around a text line. I am doing this by marking the line and then choosing Tabelle Umwandeln Text in Tabelle. The frame around the text line can be seen. When I am printing 2 pages on 1 sheet of paper I am doing this for a huge book the above line will not be printed. I know this problem from other tables. It can be frustrating. I can correct this by choosing Umrandungsstil 1pt. I feel 1pt should be the default one without having to adjust for. Its a bad look and feel if you see a line on the screen but not on the printed paper using a standard Laser printer HP4000 with a standard driver. I also feel it would be an enhancement if by clicking on Tabelle Linienstil the actual value would be shown. So would be more easy to work with. Best Regards Matthias Weisser
