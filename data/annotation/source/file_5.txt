Since OOo does not provide the feature of inserting diagonal table header the user will meet the following problems when they use drawing tool to draw diagonal line in the cells to achieve that feature the diagonal line will not be changed if the size of the cell changes if the client wanna input word at the part of diagonal line he can only do so by using self chosen text frame to input word which will be very inconvenient so we can meet user's need by inserting diagonal line table header that is to combine inserting diagonal line with inputing word to fulfill the function of inserting diagonal line table header we can add insert diagonal line table header menu item in the main menu ̢���Insert and at the same time we can build a box called inserting clined line table header. the box of inserting clined line table header is used to provide the customer with the function of choosing clined line table header format inputing word and choosing the font size of the word.
