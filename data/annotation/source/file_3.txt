I have two documents. I wish to copy text from one and paste into the other. Both documents have their text font formatted as Times New Roman 12pt. Find test documents attached as Copy odt and Paste odt When I copy at least one full paragraph including the final hard return and paste the text at the start of a paragraph however everything up to the last hard return is formatted as 10pt. Any partial paragraph up to the last hard return adopts the format of the paragraph it was pasted before. If I paste into the middle of a paragraph or copy less than one paragraph without its hard return the entire pasted text adopts the format of the paragraph it is pasted into. The key is copying and pasting between different documents. Pasting into the same document as copied from does not show this behavior. Paste Special... OpenOffice.org Writer shows the same behavior. Using Paste Special... Formatted Text RTF pastes the exact source format as expected even across documents. Using Paste Special... Unformatted Text adopts the destination format as expected even across documents. I have also verified this same behavior in OO.org Writer 1.0.4.17 Novell Build on Linux SUSE 10.
