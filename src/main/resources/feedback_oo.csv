"I want to place a frame around a text line. I am doing this by marking the line and then choosing ""Tabelle"" ""Umwandeln"" ""Text in Tabelle"". The frame around the text line can be seen. When I am printing 2 pages on 1 sheet of paper (I am doing this for a huge book) the above line will not be printed. I know this problem from other tables. It can be frustrating. I can correct this by choosing ""Umrandungsstil"" 1pt. I feel ""1pt"" should be the default one without having to adjust for. Its a bad look and feel if you see a line on the screen but not on the printed paper using a standard Laser printer HP4000 with a standard driver. I also feel it would be an enhancement if by clicking on ""Tabelle"" ""Linienstil"" the actual value would be shown. So would be more easy to work with.  Best Regards Matthias Weisser"
"I have two documents. I wish to copy text from one and paste into the other. Both documents have their text font formatted as ""Times New Roman"" 12pt. Find test documents attached as Copy.odt and Paste.odt When I copy at least one full paragraph, (including the final hard return) and paste the text at the start of a paragraph, however, everything up to the last hard return is formatted as 10pt. Any partial paragraph up to the last hard return adopts the format of the paragraph it was pasted before. If I paste into the middle of a paragraph, or copy less than one paragraph without its hard return, the entire pasted text adopts the format of the paragraph it is pasted into. The key is copying and pasting between different documents. Pasting into the same document as copied from does not show this behavior. Paste Special... OpenOffice.org Writer shows the same behavior. Using Paste Special... Formatted Text (RTF) pastes the exact source format as expected, even across documents. Using Paste Special... Unformatted Text adopts the destination format as expected, even across documents. I have also verified this same behavior in OO.org Writer 1.0.4.17 (Novell Build) on Linux SUSE 10."
Related to bug #79611 OOWriter should support bookmarks within frames aka shapes like for example within draw:text-box since 1. it is usefull and 2. the odf specs say that it's legal and imho OOWriter should follow the specs to be compatible to other word-processors like KWord where it's already implemented.
"Since OOo does not provide the feature of inserting diagonal table header, the user will meet the following problems  when they use drawing tool to draw diagonal line in the cells to achieve that feature, the diagonal line won't be changed if the size of the cell changes, if the client wanna input word at the part of diagonal line he  can only do so by using self chosen text frame to input word which will be very inconvenient, so we can meet user's need by inserting diagonal line table header that is to  combine   inserting diagonal line with inputing word to fulfill the function of inserting diagonal line table header, we can add ""insert diagonal line table header "" menu item in the main menu ̢���Insert"" and at the same time we can build a box called"" inserting clined line table header"". the box of "" inserting clined line table header is used to provide the customer with the function of choosing clined line table header format, inputing word and choosing the font size of the word."

Save all settings and exit (without needing to print anything) 2. Check how the current setting will affect the printed pages. In other words, give a direct link with ""page preview"". When he closes the ""Page preview"" window, the control should come back to the ""Print..."" window. This will allow the user to check the effect of his settings iteratively; so that he will take a print only when he is fully satisfied. BTW why call it ""page preview""? It should be called ""print preview""; because this view ACTUALLY shows how the **PRINT** looks."
Fuirst create a document using Numbering types as appropirate for Bulgaria and Russia (using Cyrillic letters instead of Latin). Then save it as a Writter document in MS Office 2000 *.doc format.

All Cyrillic letters in the numbering are replaced with numbers. Please see the attached file Cyrillic_Numbering_problems-OOo.zip with screen shots and the example file.

"I expect this is a duplicate, but I couldn't fine it. 
If a MS Word file contains a paragraph definition that uses a hanging indent, e.g.
This is the beginning of the line, followed by the

     that is typed continuously.

then, when opening this file in OpenOffice, the paragraph displays correctly. However, if it is then saved in MS Word 2000 format and then opened again, the paragraph definition fails to display / print properly. Examples of this behaviour can easily be provided. Sadly, this one defect has caused me, much to my regret, to go to the Dark Side and purchase MS Office (insert icon for crying eyes here!)"

"OEBPS and OCF are two generations of an open-standard format for eBooks, both built upon HTML, XML and ZIP. This format is used internally by proprietary eBook tools such as Microsoft Reader, MobiReader and their respective compilers, and directly by open-source, open-standard eBook readers such as OpenBerg Lector or dotReader/ThoutReader. There is also a possibility that this format will be used by One Laptop Per Child to provide eTextBooks for Third-World Children. Unfortunately, to this day, there are no open-source tools able to produce OEBPS/OCF eBooks. Which is, most definitely, a shame. I therefore suggest the inclusion of OEBPS/OCF import and export filters to OpenOffice. The export filter should be able to * convert a document to either one or several XHTML files (split by, say, chapter or section, etc. depending on the user's wishes), with their dependencies (images, style sheets, etc.) * create a metadata XML-based ""package file"" containing informations about the book title, author, subject... as well as the reading order of the split XHTML files, as per the OCF file format * for compliance with OCF, add the ODF metadata information * zip it all. Conversely, the import filter should be able to open that same format. More details about OEBPS/OCF may be found at http://www.idpf.org/specs.htm . An example open-source reader may be found at http://www.openberg.org . Caveat, I'm one of the authors."

"Actually, I would like to ask for 2 enhancement regarding the appearance of header and footer in the writer application: a) visually dimm (watermark-like) header / footer ------------------------------------------------- Dimm the appearance of header and footer while in the document (body) editing mode (in comparison to the print preview and print mode), by giving them a softer appearance, like a watermark. -> This way one can easily edit the body section of a document without being distracted by header and footer, which are often very similar to the body text (and are mostly the same for all the pages). Still one does clearly see how the document looks like with header/footer. b) protect header and footer against accidental editing ------------------------------------------------------- Using a double click rather a single click to enter editing mode for existing header / footer. This helps user to avoid accidentally modifying header / footer. (I know, there are work arounds, so one could protect it by an additional step. But let's make it easier not more difficult.) I often use templates for different documents and it would make life much easier. While I find plenty areas of OOo superior to MS Office, I find the above 2 areas more convenient solved in MSO (in editing the document body and editing existing headers / footers). (others were also looking for it: see http://www.openoffice.org/servlets/ReadMsg?listName=users&msgNo=123306 ) Thanks in advance for this enhancement. rgloor"

I tried making somewhat different changes, in either of the 2 paragraphs on that page, but it always freezes after I've added a bit of text. How long it stays alive does depend on exactly where I insert new text in that paragraph. It does seem to be reproducible. When I opened the original unedited document and continued with my editing from the paragraphs in question, it worked fine. I've tried to simplify and also obfuscate the document, but it's hard to find things to do that don't make the bug disappear. Deleting all the images (using the navigator) and replacing all e's by x's did preserve the bug, as did removing certain text, but other similar changes made the bug go away.

"1. create a new OOo text document
2. type '%theta'
3. select the entered text using HOME followed by SHIFT+END
4. convert the selected text to a formula using ALT+I, O, F 
5. attempt to type your next word

After the formula has been inserted, the *text* cursor should be given back,
rather than the resulting object being highlighted in the current way.

The current behaviour requires a rather unintuitive ESC key press before the
user can continue typing.

For anyone writing a document with a lot of formulae and symbols, this small
change would make usability quite a bit nicer.

A further unituitive thing is that after pressing ALT+I, O, F, the UP and DOWN
keys seem to move the formula around. Worse, after pressing 'UP', pressing
'DOWN' does not return the formula to its original place. And pressing 'DOWN' a
second time moves the formula *up* again. Pressing 'LEFT' and 'RIGHT' don't do
anything. I don't know what this feature is, and I don't see any conceivable use
for it; I would rather that the arrows did what I was doing just before I
pressed ALT+I, O, F: moving the cursor around my document.

I would like to say here that the forumula editor has managed to create a good
syntax that is easy to use and intuitive, so well done on that and thank you

"page numbering stays thesame, even when you go to the next page, if you're 
almost halfway page 2 (and page 2 takes in the most of your screen), it still 
says page 1 / x , and it changes when the previous page isn't visible anymore. 

That's much to late, it better changes when a page takes more than the half of 
the space on the screen.(mostly visible). 

I've already experienced a lot of inconvenience when working with someone else 
and saying the pages of corrections that I wanted to do, so that the other dude 
can make corrections. 
I kept saying the wrong page over and over again.

Everyone can duplicate this by:

- going slowly down until you're on the next page"

"The navigator has a box for entering a page number into.  The way the box works
makes it surprisingly hard to jump to a particular page number, especially on
longer documents.

If you clear the contents of this field, it will repopulate itself after a short
delay.  If you do not type fast, it is impossible to, for example, back space
over ""50"" and type ""35"" instead.  I witnessed a user end up several times with
3550 as the page number to go to.  I can't see why this field shouldn't stay
blank if you backspace over it.

(This is compounded by the fact that the contents are not selected automatically
when this field is selected.  [seemed to be the case on both Windows and Linux.]
 If contents were selected, you could simply type your new page number in,
without having to erase the first one.)

Here's another problem.  Probably meant as a feature, when you put a new number
in that field, it automatically jumps your document to that page.  But suppose
I'm on page 135, and start backspacing.  If I pause while typing, I will end up
on page 13, or page 1.  There is then no obvious way to get back to where I was
on 135.

If some or all of this is seen as ""feature"" rather than bug, then it would be
nice to have an option to disable it (perhaps labeled ""make navigator page
number field act normally."" :) ).  It would also be nice to have an Edit/Go to
page... menu option, as some MS-word users seem to get thrown for a loop when
trying to use OO.

"Currently, OOo Writer opens text files (e.g. *.txt, *.srt) in html format
instead of plain text format, if the text body contains tag-like text such as
<i>, </i> etc.

For example, a plain text file containing the following 5 lines will open in
Notepad or Microsoft Word as such:
1<i>abc</i>
2
3<i>def</i>
4
5<i>ghi</i>

But OOo Writer will open the same text file in html format instead, and display
the text body differently:
1abc 2 3def 4 5ghi

-> with letters in italics;
-> not as 5 lines but 1 line;
-> <i> and </i> not treated as plain text, but as html tags.

Actually, OOo Writer hangs or lags when large .srt files having these <i>, </i>
tags are opened. I have to use Notepad to open them, do a Ctrl-A then copy-paste
all the text into OOo Writer (to do spellchecks & editing).

"Set the font as ""Tahoma"", a TrueType/OpenType Unicode font that comes with 
Windows XP.
Enter some cyrillic letters. After the letter, insert a combining grave accent 
(U+0x0300) via ""Insert - Special Character..."". With some letters the combining 
goes as expected. With other letters the ""original"" letter gets replaced by a 
modified (accented) letter. However, the original letter is not deleted off the 
screen, and the modified letter is offset to the right.
This happens with letters U+0x0415 (Cyrillic capital letter Ie) and U+0x0418 
(Cyrillic capital letter I) and the corresponding small letters. The reason is 
that Tahoma includes the glyphs U+0x0400 (Cyrillic capital letter Ie with 
grave) and U+0x040D (Cyrillic capital letter I with grave), so OOw decides to 
change the combined symbols into one, presumably the same symbol. This does not 
happen with other ""original"" cyrillic letters, because there are no 
corresponding accented single glyphs in the font."

"Hi,

When you click on Insert->Hyperlink->Document->Target, the Target in Document
browser appears.
If you're fast and open quickly one of the branch by clicking on the + (e.g. the
Heading one), you'll see the browser closing the branch you've just open.
It just happens one time and to reproduce it, you must close the Hyperlink menu
and re-open it.

In fact, when you open the Target in Document browser, if you wait 1 second, you
see the browser flashing one time, as if It has made a refresh or something like
that. Then if you open a branch nothing will happen.

I suppose this second is the time for the browser to be up-to-date with the
actual document hierarchy.

What is annoying is that when you're fast you wonder why the browser closes itself.

"pdf export from writer results in RGB coding of text.

"1) for the first time of insert->special character please always preselect the 
current font (from the main editor)
2) please provide in the ""special character"" dialog the meta-name for the 
font ""Current"" and make it the first entry in the list

This way it would be really easy to add not-so-special characters (e.g. french 
quotes) and continue writting, but also it would be possible to keep current 
behaviour (dialog remembers last font selection, which is good)."

"When scrolling a document with multiple pages, the document scrolls up appropriately for each scroll 
event. This can be problematic because I do a scroll up, causing say 10 scroll up events and each one is 
captured and performed. But, because all are captured and performed and because of the slow 
processing of a scroll event (maybe just my machine or platform of Mac OSX 10.4.10 G4 1GB RAM) the 
time taken to scroll up a little bit is a few seconds and passes what I wanted to see in most cases. Many 
times I find myself watching what I wanted to scroll to pass by the screen as I wait for the scrolling 
events to stop being processed. I have to be very careful not to scroll too much.

NOTE: The current scrolling behavior might function just fine for existing platforms and it could be that 
it is the mac platform that generates scroll events differently and causing this issue. I remember talking 
to the NeoOffice people about scroll events and their system was at first multiplying scroll events which 
led to eradic behavior on slow machines. So, they corrected it but it leads me to believe this behavior is 
a platform issue and was solved by NeoOffice somehow so could be done here too.

What might be a simple solution to this is to capture the scroll events but if there is a bundle of them in 
the queue, don't scroll each one separately but maybe do them all at once (might be too large a jump) 
or in groups of several at a time. This would clear the queue of the events faster and probably be closer 
to what the user wishes to experience. The entire system would appear much more responsive and 
interactive. Additionally, a faster system would be able to pop these off the queue faster anyway so it 
wouldn't backup and need to skip events. Hmm, maybe a better strategy would be even to look at the 
time of events so it would process a certain time period of scroll events and not a certain number of 
events on the queue.

Here are some scenarios: 
1) I want to scroll up maybe half a page. So, I scroll up just a bit. After maybe a half second pause the 
scrolling starts and I see what I want so I stop.
Now: The screen keeps scrolling for another half second worth of scroll events. When it finally stops, I 
have to scroll down again because I overshot what I wanted by a page or half a page.
Future: Scrolling stops when user scrolling stops. Because the events were pulled from the queue en 
masse, as opposed to one at a time, the queue was cleared faster and the screen stops when the user 
wants because nothing else is on the queue.

2) I want to scroll way up the document so I do one long scroll. 
Now: The document starts to scroll up for each scroll event and I am forced to wait for each redraw of 
the document as it scrolls up 17 pages, one inch at a time. This takes several seconds.
Future: The up scroll events are captured in a group and the user is shown the document 17 screens up 
from the start of the scroll.

NOTE: It might be somewhat disorienting this way so a ramp-up and ramp-down of scroll events might 
be the desired feel of scrolling."

"Description of Problem:
When a chemical drawing is copied from ChemDraw onto clipboard, and then pasted into Writer, it get

1. copy a drawing from ChemDraw onto clipboard (select -> apple+C)
2. paste into writer (apple + V)

Actual Results:
drawing pasted as  bitmap

Expected Results:
drawing pasted as a high resolution object that can be can be later copied onto clipboard, then pasted 
back in ChemDraw and further modified in this program.

How often does this happen?
always

Additional Information (OS patch level, drivers, library
version, etc.)
MacOSX, 10.4.10, OpenOffice Aqua alpha version (aquavcl01_20070630.) !same thing happens in the 
latest OpenOffice X11 version! 

I contacted ChemDraw about this issue and here's their answer:

""I got some feedback on this from development. When a copy takes place from ChemDraw, we put a lot 
of different file formats on the clipboard. It is then up to the application in which you want to paste to 
get the correct format from the clipboard. In OpenOffice on Windows the default is bitmap when pasted 
but for OLE manipulation you need the enhanced metafile format. But at least on Windows you have 
the choice of doing this manually through the 'paste as' functionality. On Mac this functionality does 
not seem to be available and OpenOffice is not picking the desired format from the clipboard. It seems 
that this is a limitation on the side of OpenOffice and there is not much we can do about that.

We suggest you contact the OpenOffice people and have a request entered to solve this problem. If 
they do require our assistance with regards to selecting the appropriate format for chemical structures 
from the clipboard they can always contact us.  """

"(I opened this under writer but it could be extended to impress too)

I'd like writer to gain a side-by side diff feature. This feature is common in
text editors (an exemple there: http://meld.sourceforge.net/meld_file1.png)

Why: I often participate in processes where a contractual document is drafted by
several parties. When one of the writers releases a new version comparing it to
the last version reviewed is the fastest way to detect changes that may impact
your party. Right now that's a complex dance of revision marks, printing both
versions and comparing manually, etc

Why revision marks do not cut it:

1. They can't be left in the finalised document. So a document with revision
marks is always different from the actual ""official"" document.

2. If you receive a document with revision marks in you can never be sure
someone didn't already accept a change, hiding it from review (this is quite
common and occurs even when people are not being malicious, they just make
editing mistakes).

1+2 means you end up accepting all revisions inconditionnaly in the document
with revisions, then comparing it to the document without revisions to check
they are the same, then comparing to the previous ""good"" version to check no
revision was left out. This is a time-consuming chore that severily detracts
from in-document revision mark usefulness.

3. Revision marks force a formatting reflow.
 - Often the reflow is so severe a document with revision marks is totally
unreadable.
 - It does funny stuff with tables and floating images
 - The reflow changes the page numbers, so people never know if the page they're
commenting on has the same number for other reviewers

4. Accumulating revision marks on a complex document is a shortcut to document
corruption and Office Suite crashes, especially when combined with repeated
OO.o/ODF <-> Word/DOC roundtrip conversions

5. You can't use revision marks with protected documents. You need to unprotect
them before doing a compare. Unprotecting a document sometimes triggers a lot of
automated changes when the point is to compare unchanged authoritative versions

6. writer complains if you ask it to generate revision marks between documents
that already include revision marks

I'd like to be able to point writer to two documents (protected or not, that
include revision marks or not) and have it display them side-by-side,
highlighting differences, ignoring any existing revision marks, without changing
the formatting, page numbering, etc of the compared documents

This feature would be especially appealing now that widescreens are common."

"When one adds revision marks to a document by asking writer to compare it to a
previous version, all the revisions are attributed to him.

This leads to not-so-funny episodes when other reviewers assume a problem change
was authored by the person that asked writer to create the revision marks.

Please have writer attribute automatically created revision marks to no one, or
to a neutral entity (Unknown, auto, whatever)"

"For people who are visually impared, the vertical line that forms the text 
mode cursor is difficult to find on a screen full of text. It would be good if 
an alternative cursor were available for visibility. For example an open box 
would be easier to find than the vertical line. Better yet a colored block 
cursor would be more visible. In the extreem case, the choice to make it blink 
would make it even more visoble. (Remember the blinking cursor from the VT50 
days?)

Note that this is different from the mouse cursor which can often be changed 
at the OS level."

"Instead of replacing the word, the thesaurus replaces the period at the end of
the sentence with the synonym if the cursor was after the period.

Reproduce like this (in English):

Type ""Timber."". Leave the cursor after the period.

Press Ctrl-F7. Pick ""Lumber"" as replacement.

You get: ""TimberLumber"""

"Create a document with two columns (or create a section with two columns).
Create a table within that document, with two rows and two columns.
In the second row of the table, create a manual break > column break.

Nothing happens.

Expected behavior should be that the second table row moves into the second column."

"When having highlighted a text and the highlighting button is pressed the
highlighting does not stop.
To get text not to be highlighted after a paragraph of highlighting the text
needs to be typed then selected and then no fill highlighting needs to be chosen."

"If I have a .doc document with a password-protected section, and I import it 
in OOWriter, the section is protected ok but with no password."

"If you protect the 1st section of a document in MSWord the header is 
automatically protected. If you import the document in OOWriter, the 1st 
section is correctly protected, but the header looses the protection."

"Importing a .doc document and saving it in .doc again looses many of the 
bookmarks of the file. You can see an example in the attached .doc file. The 
bookmarks are tied to text form fields, but we can see no relation to which 
fields are kept and which ones not. 

To reproduce the problem:

* open the document in OOWriter, remove the protection on section 1
* go to Insert-Bookmarks (you can see many bookmarks)
* save the document (in .doc format) and open it again in OOWriter
* go to Insert-Bookmarks, they are still there
* open it in MSWord
* go to Insert-Bookmars, there are only few bookmarks"

"It would be very nice, if there were the possibility, to define the dependencies between two 
templates (paragraphes or page or other) more accurately.

This means: If you define a template depending on another, it inherites the properties from 
the ""father-template"" like the font, its size, the alignment etc. If you change a property from the 
father-template later, the change will occure at the child-template, too.

So far, so good.

But if you have more complicated dependencies, i.e. more templates connected to each other, 
you will eventually want to change a property at the father-template and at some of the 
child-templates, but not at all child-templates.
Therefor we would need a possibility, to express, which properties of the child-template should be 
changed, when the father-template is changed, and which properties should remain origin.

I know that you can change the child-template manually back to the origin. And this will do, if the 
dependencies are not very complex. But otherwise it would be a nice enhancement.

I think, this issue is not placed correctly at ""Word processor"", because the behaviour is general. 
Please reassume."
